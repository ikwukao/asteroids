# 🚀 Asteroids

A modern Python implementation of the classic **Asteroids** arcade game built with **Pygame**. Pilot your ship through an endless asteroid field, dodge incoming rocks, and blast them into smaller fragments before they destroy you.

This project was built as part of the **Boot.dev Backend Development** curriculum to practice object-oriented programming, game loops, collision detection, sprite management, and real-time game development using Python.

## ✨ Features

* 🎮 Smooth player movement and rotation
* 🔫 Shoot projectiles with cooldown mechanics
* ☄️ Procedurally spawning asteroids
* 💥 Asteroid splitting mechanics
* 🎯 Collision detection between:

  * Player and asteroids
  * Shots and asteroids
* 🧩 Object-oriented architecture
* 📦 Sprite groups for updating and rendering
* 📝 Event and game-state logging
* ⚡ Fixed 60 FPS game loop using delta time

## 📸 Gameplay

Control your ship, avoid collisions, and survive as long as possible while destroying incoming asteroids.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ikwukao/asteroids.git
cd asteroids
```

### Install dependencies

Using **uv**:

```bash
uv sync
```

## ▶️ Running the Game

Launch the game with:

```bash
uv run main
```

A game window will open where you can fly your ship and destroy asteroids.
